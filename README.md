The international supply chain has been severely disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. International shipping industry, which accounts for 90 percent of the world total shipment, has experienced great uncertainty. Goods that used to take two weeks from Asia to North America now requires 45 days to reach the other side of the Pacific Ocean and costs more than ten times the original price.

Crewmen, who serve in the core of the industry, are facing tremendous stress and frustration. Many have spent almost one year floating in the sea, stuck in their tiny cabin and waiting for permission to get off and go home. They haven’t stepped on soil since the day they set off, as countries have banned seafarers from landing as usual when they arrive ports. In some countries with stringent intervention policy, sailors need to wait long time on ship before unloading cargo. Some sailors couldn’t go home due to lack of labor for shift or frequently cancelled flights. Overtime service and loneliness are ruining their mental health as well.

I’ve talked to sailors and according to their common experience, governments of different countries have come up with some measures to facilitate the shifts of seafarers to make the shipping process smoother, but things are not improving a lot. This story focuses on the difficulties sailors are facing when trying to make shifts and get home, the measures that have been taken and why they were not working to ease the situation, and the future of this industry after the pandemic.

For the data part in this repo, I used to QGIS to draw ship routes map at the port of Long Beach before and during the pandemic to show the extent of congestion. Raw data are from AIS via Bloomberg Terminal.

Other data also include shipping fee, labor supply and shipping shedule reliability. Sources are included inside the files.
