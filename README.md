The international supply chain has been severely disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. International shipping industry, which accounts for 90 percent of the world total shipment, has experienced great uncertainty. Goods that used to take two weeks to get from Asia to North America now require 45 days to reach the other side of the Pacific Ocean and can cost more than ten times the original price.

Crewmen, who serve in the core of the industry, are facing tremendous stress and frustration. Many have spent almost one year floating in the sea, stuck in their tiny cabin and waiting for permission to get off and go home. They haven’t stepped on soil since the day they set off, as countries have banned seafarers from landing as usual when they arrive ports. In some countries with stringent intervention policy, sailors need to wait long time on ship before unloading cargo. Some sailors couldn’t go home due to lack of labor for shift or frequently cancelled flights. Overtime service and loneliness are ruining their mental health as well.

The pandemic has interrupted the industry’s talent system as well. Many young and inexperienced sailors are being promoted to make up vacancy for Second and Third Officers, aka, experienced drivers of ships and carriers, which adds up risks of ship accidents, such as Ever Given blocking the Suez Canal in March 2021.

Coming into 2022, experts worry that the shipping industry might be enmeshed in overcapacity challenge, as many ships that should have retired extended their service after refurnishing, but a potential global economic stagflation means there aren’t enough goods for these ships to transport. It would be a nightmare for many shipping companies and crewmen if this scenario came true.

I’ve talked to sailors and according to their common experience, governments of different countries have come up with some measures to facilitate the shifts of seafarers to make the shipping process smoother, but things are not improving a lot. This story focuses on the difficulties sailors are facing when trying to make shifts and get home, the measures that have been taken and why they were not working to ease the situation, and the future of this industry after the pandemic.

For the data part in this repo, I used to QGIS to draw ship routes map at the port of Long Beach before and during the pandemic to show the extent of congestion. Raw data are from AIS via Bloomberg Terminal.

Other data also include shipping fee, labor supply and shipping shedule reliability. Sources are included inside the files.
